I was thinking of an app for tracking running/walking distance and time.

The app would use gps coordinates and you would start the program, it would then calculate time, distance and rate.

For the external part it would use google maps to draw a line how far you ran.

Then you could aggregate data and have some kind of chart to see progress in each of the areas.  You could have a weekly chart and a monthly chart or something like that.

You would probably need some kind of pause mechanism for those times you are stuck at a light.  Could handle this two ways: one could set a specific time to auto-engage pause; the other could be manual pause.  The problem with this is that if the gps is accurate to ten meters then might not be able to do it... anyway what you guys think?
